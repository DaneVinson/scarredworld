Produced by the Dwarves of [Karrgerra](./trade-partner-2.md), Steel Paste appears as a dense, black, oily paste. When spread upon a surface and correctly treated it hardens into a layer of incredibly strong metal providing the covered object with exceptional durability. Protected objects gain Damage Reduction for all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
