Around 20 miles east of Nexus is a long, thin strip of Wasteland known as Verman's Path. It was formed by a short lived and relatively small [Chaos Storm](./chaos-storms.md) in 732 AS and was named after the Wizard Verman the Seer who accurately predicted the time, location and path of the Storm weeks in advance.
