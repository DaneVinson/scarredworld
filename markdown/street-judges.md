The Justicars, commonly called *Street Judges*, are the martial arm of the [Adjudicators](./judges.md). Its members typically hold command positions in the city's armed forces. They can be commonly found in all parts of the city and at all hours. *Street Judges* are known to be fair in their rulings but have a reputation for being harsh to dissention. Many members of the [Radiant Arms](./paladins.md) serve as Justicars.
