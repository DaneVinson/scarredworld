__The White Code__: _Act with justice. Speak only truth. Protect the innocent._

The Order of the Radiant Arms is an association of knights each of whom has sworn to uphold The White Code unto death. They typically do so with a religious zeal. 

Some Radiant Arms serve as members of the [Justicars](./street-judges.md) while others take the role of Knight Errant bearing living witness to the The White Code wherever they roam. Many of the greatest heroes of Nexus's history have been members of the Radiant Arms and that tradition continues to this day.
