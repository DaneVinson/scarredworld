# Menalay River 
[Scarred World](./scarred-world.md) > Menalay River

The head of the Menalay River is found in the [Cudgel Mountains](./cudgel-mountains.md) over 300 miles northeast of [Nexus](./city.md). From there it runs west to a large lake on the eastern side of the [Sliprun Mountains](./sliprun-mountains.md), then through the mountains, west through [Verman's Path](./vermans-path.md) then to Nexus where it meets the sea. Once an excellent source of both fresh water and fish the waters than reach Nexus are now poisoned by the runoff from Verman's Path.
