Poof is the common name for the Wafers distributed by the [Feeders](./feeders.md). Consumption of a single Wafer supplies the equivalent of one day's ration, food and water. By law all citizens and guests of the  are entitled to one Wafer each day.

All Poof Wafers are created by Life Cleric members of the [Feeders](./feeders.md). The majority of these worship [Raya](./pantheon.md). Stations distributing the Wafers are plentiful within city walls.
