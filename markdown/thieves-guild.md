The Thieves Guild of Nexus has its origins in the catacombs of the city just after the [Scarring](./scarred-world.md). Originally the group was very small, conducting their business as a means of surviving the harsh conditions. When the people of Nexus made their way back to the surface the organization became more formalized and took the name The Red Hand.

Today thievery is quite rare in Nexus and it carries extremely harsh penalties including [Expulsion](./expulsion.md). As such the thefts that do occur are generally well planned and precisely executed and members of The Red Hand are invariable responsible. The organization is highly secretive and uses small isolated cells to maintain security. Thieves found operating outside this structure generally meet a quiet and permanent end. 

Jobs performed by The Red Hand are typically made known to the public by the mark of The Red Hand at the scene.
