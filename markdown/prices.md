### Taxes
All commerce within [Nexus, City of Coins](./city.md) is assessed a 10% tax.

### *True* Food and Drink
*True* indicates a food or beverage is of natural origin.
All *True* food costs are drastically increased from those listed in the PH. *True* food costs can easily be 100x the PH value. For example the PH shows a loaf of bread costs 2 cp. A loaf of *True* bread in the streets of Nexus starts at 2 gp.

### Poof Spirits
*Poof Spirits* is the common name for any beverage made from the distillation or fermentation of [Poof Wafers](./poof.md). Consumption of *Poof Spirits* produces intoxication. However, the effect is typically a muted version of that produced by alcohol (*True Sprits*). The cost of *Poof Spirit* is the same as listed in the PH for its equivalent *True* counterpart. Example: 1 gallon of Poof ale costs 2 sp.
