Very little is known about the history of The Mad Alchemist. There are references to the alchemist  Meister Von Strit in the archives of [Nexus](./city.md) from several hundred years before the [Scarring](./scarred-world.md) but of his origins there is nothing. What is known is that he's a powerful arcanist, a master alchemist and a complete recluse hiding away in his magical tower Spire. From there he sells [The Green](./green.md) and his other potions, ointments and elixirs to anyone that will pay his prices.
