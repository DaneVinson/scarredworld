# Spire [CN]
[Scarred World](./scarred-world.md) > Spire

Spire is a river city with a population of approximately 50K. Located 1000 miles North of [Nexus](./city.md). It is entirely controlled by [The Alchemist](./alchemist.md).

Long before the cataclysm Vonstrit created an impossibly high and thin tower known as The Spire. After the cataclysm the region's survivors fled to The Spire in hope of protection. Vonstrit was benevolent, he didn't kill them.

It quickly became apparent that The Spire served as exceptional protection from the forces unleashed by the cataclysm. Extra-planar creatures have never been found within 20 miles of Spire and in several recorded instances [Chaos Storms](./chaos-storms.md) have been seen to change course, going around Spire. It's obvious to most that Vonstrit is the source of these protections.

## Government
No real form of government exists within Spire. The will of Vonstrit is enforced mercilessly but he typically has little concern or regard for the people of Spire. Unless they get in his way he ignores them.

## Life in the Spire
Though the people are not threatened by supernatural creatures or random Chaos Storms they survive within a small region of safety. The city is perpetually low on all critical resources. This brings about desperate living conditions. Daily life for many of Spire citizens is dominated by the struggle for one more day's food. Many choose [The Green](./green.md).

## Trade
All trade outside Spire comes from Nexus. The majority of this is conducted with Vonstrit exclusively but some [Merchant-Traders](./merchants.md) have found working with the citizens of Spire can be lucrative.
