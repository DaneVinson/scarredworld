# Spire (City of the Mad Alchemist) [CN]
[Scarred World](./scarred-world.md) > Spire (City of the Mad Alchemist)

Spire is an inland "city" ~500 miles south of [Nexus](./city.md). Its population of ~50K is entirely controlled by [Meister Von Strit (The Mad Alchemist)](./alchemist.md).

Long before the [Scarring](./scarred-world.md) Meister Von Strit created an impossibly high and thin tower known as The Spire. After the Scarring the region's survivors fled to The Spire in hope of protection. Meister Von Strit was benevolent, he didn't kill them.

It quickly became apparent that The Spire served as exceptional protection from the forces unleashed by the Scarring. Extra-planar creatures have never been found within 20 miles of Spire and in several recorded instances [Chaos Storms](./chaos-storms.md) have been seen to change course, going around Spire. It's obvious to most that Meister Von Strit is the source of these protections.

## Government
No real form of government exists within Spire. The will of Meister Von Strit is enforced mercilessly but he typically has little concern or regard for the people of Spire. Unless they get in his way he ignores them.

## Life in the Spire
Though the people are not threatened by supernatural creatures or random Chaos Storms they survive within a small region of safety. The city is perpetually low on all critical resources. This brings about desperate living conditions. Daily life for many of Spire citizens is dominated by the struggle for the day's food. Some choose [The Green](./green.md).

## Trade
Most trade in Spire comes from Nexus. The majority of this is conducted with Meister Von Strit but some [Merchant-Traders](./merchants.md) have found working with the citizens of Spire can be lucrative.
