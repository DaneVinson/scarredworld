After the cataclysm most gods abandoned the Scarred World for lack of worshippers. The few that remained laid claim to broad domains of influence.

### Raya [NG]

Typically appearing as a beautiful human female Raya reigns over the domains of life, love, peace, justice, food, music drink and joy. Her most common symbol is the golden chalice.
