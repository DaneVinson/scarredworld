Karrgerra is a two-thousand year old Dwarven stronghold. The only known access to the underground kingdom is through an impenetrable citadel on the interior edge of a small bay ringed by thousand foot cliffs. Karrgerra exports [Steel Paste](./steel-paste.md) and the highest quality weapons and armor both magical and mundane. They import [Poof](./poof.md), magical wonders created by [Magnus Arcana](./wizards.md), mundane items created by [Tradesmen's Guild](./tradesmen.md) and the exotic elixirs obtained through trade with [Spire](./trade-partner-1.md).
