# Cudgel Mountains 
[Scarred World](./scarred-world.md) > Cudgel Mountains

The imposing Cudgel Mountains run north to south over 300 miles east of [Nexus](./city.md). With peaks as high at two miles they dwarf the [Sliprun Mountains](./sliprun-mountains.md) in both size and ruggedness. Very little is know about the current state of the range but historical records in Nexus tell of a large Elven kingdom named Silverest that once lay on the east side of the mountains. Whether that kingdom survived the [Scarring](./scarred-world.md) or not is unknown.
