# Nexus, City of Coins [NG]
[Scarred World](./scarred-world.md) > Nexus, City of Coins

The port city of Nexus is home to more than 250K people. Commonly called the City of Coins its culture and politics are dominated by trade and commerce. Nexus is located between its two primary trading partners, the cities of [Spire (City of the Mad Alchemist)](./trade-partner-1.md) and [Karrgerra (Dwarven Stronghold)](./trade-partner-2.md). Its chief exports are the [Poof Wafers](./poof.md) created by the [Benevolent Benefactors](./feeders.md), wondrous items created by [Magnus Arcana](./wizards.md) and all manner of exceptional inert items created by the [Tradesmen's Guild](./tradesmen.md). Primary imports from Spire are [The Green](./green.md) and its other faboulus elixirs. From Karrgerra comes [Steel Paste](./steel-paste.md) and the surperior metal works of the Dwarves.

## Government
Nexus is governed by the *Pentacouncil* which consists of a *Chair* and four member *Seats*. By law the *Chair* belongs to the *Judge General* of the [Adjudicators](./judges.md) and *Seats* to representatives of [Magnus Arcana](./wizards.md), the [Benevolent Benefactors](./feeders.md), the [Commerce Guild](./bankers.md) and the [Merchant-Traders](./merchants.md).

The *Chair's* primary charge is to ensure the safety and well-being of Nexus and its citizens. In service of that charge the *Chair* has direct command of the city's martial resources. Historically, those sitting in the *Chair* have faithfully used the later in fulfillment of the former.

For all issues before the *Pentacouncil* 

* Each *Seat* receives one vote
* The *Chair* receives two votes 
* The *Chair* receives an additional deadlock vote
* The *Chair* has *Veto* power over all *New* legislation

## Life in the City of Coins
The availability of [Poof](./poof.md) means all people are free from the daily need to acquire food. This fact liberates the populace to pursue goals beyond daily provisioning for self and family. As a result the majority of Nexus' citizens have some significant skill in at least one art, trade or discipline. Every organization from [Magnus Arcana](./wizards.md) to the smallest blacksmith in the [Tradesmen's Guild](./tradesmen.md) is inundated with requests for apprenticeship by well qualified applicants. From the walls of the keep to the roof on the lowliest house the entire city is soundly constructed and well maintained. Craftsmen, artisans and performers of every stripe exist in multitude and the majority of them are skilled in their trade. Theaters and concert halls are abundant and accessible to all. Truly the people of Nexus have a good life.

Life in Nexus would be like a golden age if not for two facts. First, everyone understands exactly what the [Chaos Storms](./chaos-storms.md) mean. On any day everything could be un-made. Second, [Poof](./poof.md) satisfies the need for food and water but it leaves some deeper _hunger_ quite unsatisfied. Individual responses to this _hunger_ vary erratically.

## Trade and Commerce
The flow of money has primacy in the City of Coins and any entity conducting commercial trade within Nexus must be a licensed member of the [Merchant-Traders](./merchants.md). Those found out of compliance are subject to immediate punishment up to and including [Expulsion](./expulsion.md).

## Taxes
All monetary transactions within Nexus are taxed at the rate of 10%. All prices listed in the PH or otherwise should be increased by 10%. Any entity found attempting to avoid the *Lawful Tax* are be subject to immediate punishment up to and including [Expulsion](./expulsion.md).

## Catacombs
In the first decades after the [Scarring](./scarred-world.md) [Chaos Storms](./chaos-storms.md) were frequent. Early survivors took any subterranean refuge available to them. For Nexus this meant utilizing the ancient burial crypts of the city's noble ancestors. The initial survivors called these crypts home for almost three decades and throughout that time they continued to excavate adding to their underground domain. As the early wave of [Chaos Storms](./chaos-storms.md) subsided people left the catacombs for a new life on the surface and in the following decades the catacombs were sealed by proclamation of the first *Pentacouncil*.

Over the centuries the catacombs of Nexus have become the domain of the undead. Several intelligent undead lords came to hold sway over the region and they've held a restless peace with the living of Nexus for generations. The undead lords know that if the might of the Nexus were rallied against them they'd be eradicated. Likewise, the lords of Nexus know they could exterminate the undead entirely but doing so would incur grievous losses. Thus, the undead generally confine their activities to the catacombs and the leaders of Nexus generally act as if the undead do not exist.
