## Government
Nexus is governed by the Pentacouncil which consists of a Chair and four member Seats. By law the Chair belongs to the *Judge General* of the [Adjudicators](./adjudicators.md) and Seats to one representative each from [Magnus Arcanus](./magnus-arcanus.md), the [Benevolent Benefactors](./feeders.md), the [Commerce Guild](./commerce-guild.md) and the [Merchant-Traders](./merchant-traders.md).

On all issues before the Pentacouncil each Member has one vote. The Chair has two. At any deadlock the Chair receives an additional vote. The Chair has Veto power over all new legislation. The Chair's first charge is to ensure the safety and well-being of the Nexus and its citizens. The Chair has direct command of city's military. Historically, the Chair has used the later to fulfill of the former.

## Life in the City of Coins
The free distribution of [Poof](./poof.md) means even the lowliest of peoples are free from the daily pursuit of food. This liberates all to pursue goals beyond providing for self and family. As a result the majority of Nexus' citizens have some significant skill in at least one art, trade or discipline. Every organization from [Magnus Arcanus](./magnus-arcanus.md) to the smallest blacksmith in the [Tradesman's Guild](./tradesmens-guild.md) is inundated with requests for apprenticeship from well qualified applicants. All structures in the city from the keep to the roof of the lowliest house are soundly constructed and well maintained. Craftsmen, artisans and performers of every stripe exist in multitude and the majority of them are skilled in their crafts. Theaters and concert halls are abundant and accessible to all. Truly the people of Nexus have a good life.

Life in Nexus would be as a Golden Age if not for two facts. First, everyone understands they're a `Chaos Storm` away from being un-made. Second, [Poof](./poof.md) "satisfies" the need for food and water but it leaves some deeper hunger quite unsatisfied.

## Trade and Commerce
The flow of money has primacy in the City of Coins and any entity conducting commercial trade or commerce within Nexus must be a licensed member of the [Merchant-Traders](.merchant-traders.md). Those found out of compliance will be subject to immediate punishment up to and including [Expulsion](./expulsion.md).

## Taxes
All monetary transactions within Nexus are taxed at the rate of 10%. All prices listed in the PH or otherwise should be increased by 10%. Any entity found attempting to avoid this lawful Tax will be subject to immediate punishment up to and including [Expulsion](./expulsion.md).
