## Government
Nexus is governed by the Pentacouncil which consists of a Chair and four member Seats. By law the Chair belongs to the *Judge General* of the [Adjudicators](./judges.md) and Seats to one representative each from [Magnus Arcana](./wizards.md), the [Benevolent Benefactors](./feeders.md), the [Commerce Guild](./bankers.md) and the [Merchant-Traders](./merchants.md).

On all issues before the Pentacouncil each Member has one vote. The Chair has two. At any deadlock the Chair receives an additional vote. The Chair has Veto power over all new legislation. The Chair's first charge is to ensure the safety and well-being of the Nexus and its citizens. The Chair has direct command of city's military. Historically, the Chair has used the later to fulfill of the former.

## Life in the City of Coins
The free distribution of [Poof](./poof.md) means even the lowliest of people are free from the daily pursuit of food. This liberates all to pursue goals beyond providing for self and family. As a result the majority of Nexus' citizens have some significant skill in at least one art, trade or discipline. Every organization from Magnus Arcana to the smallest blacksmith in the Tradesmen's Guild is inundated with requests for apprenticeship from well qualified applicants. All structures in the city from the keep to the roof of the lowliest house are soundly constructed and well maintained. Craftsmen, artisans and performers of every stripe exist in multitude and the majority of them are experts in their vocation. Theaters and concert halls are abundant and accessible to all. Truly the people of Nexus have a good life.

Life in Nexus would be like a golden age if not for two facts. First, everyone understands exactly what the [Chaos Storms](./chaos-storms.md) mean. On any day anything could be un-made. Second, Poof satisfies the need for food and water but it leaves some deeper _hunger_ quite unsatisfied. People's responses to this _hunger_ vary erratically.

## Trade and Commerce
The flow of money has primacy in the City of Coins and any entity conducting commercial trade or commerce within Nexus must be a licensed member of the Merchant-Traders. Those found out of compliance will be subject to immediate punishment up to and including [Expulsion](./expulsion.md).

## Taxes
All monetary transactions within Nexus are taxed at the rate of 10%. All prices listed in the PH or otherwise should be increased by 10%. Any entity found attempting to avoid this lawful Tax will be subject to immediate punishment up to and including Expulsion.

## Catacombs
In the first decades after the cataclysm Chaos Storms were much more frequent than today. Early survivors took any subterranean refuge available to them. For Nexus this meant utilizing the ancient burial crypts of the city's noble ancestors. The initial survivors called these crypts home for almost three decades and throughout that time they continued to excavate adding to their underground domain. As the Chaos Storms subsided people left the catacombs for a new life on the surface and over the next decade they're home for a generation was sealed up by proclamation of the first Pentacouncil.

Over the centuries the catacombs of Nexus have become the domain of the undead. Several intelligent undead lords hold sway over this domain but they share a restless peace with the citizens of Nexus. The undead lords know that if the might of the city were to go against them they would be eradicated. Likewise the powers of Nexus know they could exterminate the undead entirely but doing so would incur grievous losses. Thus, a form of peace is maintained. The undead mostly confine their activities to the catacombs and the leaders of Nexus can go on as if the undead do not exist.
