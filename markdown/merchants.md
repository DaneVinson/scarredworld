# Merchant-Traders [CN]
[Scarred World](./scarred-world.md) > [Nexus](./city.md) > Merchant-Traders

After the catastrophe and the people's emergence from the catacombs of [Nexus](./city.md) various merchants, traders, vagabonds and grifters began organizing. Through force of will that organization became the Merchant-Traders. Merchant-Traders were responsible for first contact with [Spire](./trade-partner-1.md) and [Karrgerra](./trade-partner-2.md) and to this day they have significant interests in all trade activates to both. Their early influence earned them a seat on the [Nexus](./city.md) *Pentacouncil* and today they remain one of Nexus's most powerful organizations.
