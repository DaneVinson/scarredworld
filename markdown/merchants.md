Shortly after emergence from the catacombs of [Nexus](./city.md) traders, vagabonds and people of low morals began organizing. Through force of will that organization became the Merchant-Traders. The Merchant-Traders were responsible for first contact with [Spire](./trade-partner-1.md) and [Karrgerra](./trade-partner-2.md) and started robust trade activity to both. Today the Merchant-Traders have interests in almost all Nexus commerce.
