# Southern Wasteland 
[Scarred World](./scarred-world.md) > Southern Wasteland

In 534 AS the [Chaos Storm](./chaos-storms.md) that created the Southern Wasteland raged for weeks. Its fury was felt over 100 miles away in [Nexus](./city.md) where there were earthquakes, rains of both ice and stone and for weeks following horrific supernatural creatures which attacked Nexus and its inhabitants. In the following years various explorers mapped the edges of the Wasteland finding that it was as close as 120 miles southeast of Nexus and crossed both the [Sliprun Mountains](./sliprun-mountains.md) and the [Cudgel Mountains](./cudgel-mountains.md). To this day, 200 years later, the Wasteland is a toxic dead zone with little to no life to be found within.
