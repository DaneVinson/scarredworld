As the name suggests Chaos Storms are storms of pure chaos. They can appear as anything from cyclones to towering thunder-heads miles wide. They may be wildly colored, dark and grey or void black. The one constant is that when Chaos Storms pass they leave destruction in their wake. Everything in a storm's path is utterly un-made leaving behind land scoured to a smooth surface of toxic grey sand.
