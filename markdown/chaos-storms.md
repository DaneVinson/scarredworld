As its name suggests a Chaos Storms is a storm made of pure chaos. They can appear as cyclones or towering thunder-heads and may be wildly colored, dark and grey or void of color altogether. The one constant is that as a Chaos Storms passes it leaves destruction in its wake. Everything in the path of a storm is utterly un-made leaving the land scoured to a smooth surface of toxic grey sand.
