# Scarred World
Untold millennia ago a catastrophic event left the world open to random contact with the outer planes. Large portions of the planetâ€™s surface were wiped away by pure chaos or populated with supernatural horrors. Today most of the world is uninhabitable and much of the rest is unnavigable. Only the most powerful pockets of mortal civilization remain. Characters begin the campaign in one such pocket, [Nexus, City of Coins](./city-of-coins.md).

## Character Creation
Players may use any of the races and classes defined in the Player's Handbook (PH). Character ability scores are generated as described in the PH. Additionally, players may generate their character's ability scores by manually distributing 72 total points across the 6 abilities (20 maximum). Increases to maximum hit points (MaxHP) on level advancement works as described in the PH with one exception, if a player chooses to roll new hit dice they do so *with advantage*. Example: Gruger the Half-Orc Fighter advances from 1st to 2nd level, the Player may either increase his MaxHP by 6 or by best d10 in 2d10 (thanks Mike).

## Campaign Start
Characters begin in [Nexus, City of Coins](./city-of-coins.md) as contracted members of the [Maqamir Trading Company](./maqamir.md). Duties vary widely but each character has signed the [employment contract](./contract.md). Players may decide upon any background they wish for their character as long as it encompasses this fact.
