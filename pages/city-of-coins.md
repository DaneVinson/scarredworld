## Life in Nexus
After the creation of Poof even the lowlest of people were freed from the daily pursuit of food. This liberated even the poorest to pursue goals beyond putting food on the table. Now, thousands of years later, the majority of Nexus' citizens have some significant skill in at least one art, trade or discipline. Every organization from [Magnus Arcanus](./magnus-arcanus.md) to the smallest blacksmith in the [Tradesman's Guild](./tradesmens-guild.md) is inandated with requests for apprentiship from well qualified applicants. All structures in the city from the outer walls to the roof of the lowliest house are soundly constructed and well maintained. Craftsmen, artizens and performers of every stripe exist in multitude and the majority of them are excellent at their crafts. Theaters and concert halls are abundant at price points that make them available to all. Truly the people of Nexus have a good life.

Life in Nexus would be like a Golden Age if not for two facts. First, everyone knows they're one Chaos Storm away from being un-made. Second, Poof leaves some deeper hunger unsatiated.
