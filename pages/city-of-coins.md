Primary imports are [The Green]() and the elixers of `Spire`, and `Steel Paste` and the weapons and arms of `Karrgerra`.

## Life in the City of Coins
The free distribution of [Poof](./poof.md) means even the lowlest of peoples are free from the daily pursuit of food. This liberates all to pursue goals beyond putting food on the table. The majority of Nexus' citizens have some significant skill in at least one art, trade or discipline. Every organization from [Magnus Arcanus](./magnus-arcanus.md) to the smallest blacksmith in the [Tradesman's Guild](./tradesmens-guild.md) is inandated with requests for apprentiship from well qualified applicants. All structures in the city from the keep, to the outer walls, to the roof of the lowliest house are soundly constructed and well maintained. Craftsmen, artizens and performers of every stripe exist in multitude and the majority of them are skilled in their crafts. Theaters and concert halls are abundant and accessable to all. Truly the people of Nexus have a good life.

Life in Nexus would be as a Golden Age if not for two facts. First, everyone lives with the knowledge that they're a `Chaos Storm` away from being un-made. Second, [Poof](./poof.md) leaves some deeper hunger unsatiated and that hunger builds.

## Trade and Commerce
The flow of money has primacy in the City of Coins and Any entity conducting commercial trade or commerce within Nexus must be a licensed member of the Merchant-Traders. Those found out of compliance will be subject to immeadiate punishment up to and including [Expulsion](./expulsion.md).
