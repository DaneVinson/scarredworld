# Adjudicators [NG]
[Scarred World](./scarred-world.md) > [City of Coins](./city-of-coins.md) > Adjudicators

Adjudicators ultimately sit in judgment of everything that occurs within the influence of [Nexus](./city-of-coins.md). Law dictates that the *Pentacouncil Chair* be reserved for the *Judge General* of the Adjudicators. They use the power of the *Chair* and their control over the city's martial resources to protect the city from all threats.
