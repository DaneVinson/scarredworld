[Scarred World](./scarred-world.md) > [City of Coins](./city-of-coins.md) > Adjudicators

The Adjudicators sit in lawful judgment of everything that occurs within the influence of [Nexus](./city-of-coins.md). Law dictates that the *Pentacouncil Chair* be reserved for the *Judge General* of the Adjudicators. They use the power of the *Chair* and its control of the city's martial resources to ensure peace and protection for all in their influence.
