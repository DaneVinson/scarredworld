# The Benevolent Benefactors (Feeders)

Shortly after cataclysm Life clerics in Nexus realized that there was not enough usable land available to support the farming and livestock needed to feed population. The most powerful of them set upon themselves the task of solving the coming food crisis. The city almost fell to starvation and chaos but the Goddess [Raya](./pantheon.md) blessed the faithful Life priests with the power to create [Wafers (Poof)](./poof.md). Since then no citizen of Nexus has gone hungry.

The Benevolent Benefactors have grown into the monolithic organization commonly referred to as The Feeders. The Feeders are responsible for providing Poof to all citizens of Nexus and today they even produce a surplus which is often sold to the city's trading partners. 

All Poof is created by the spells of Life cleric members of The Feeders. The vast majority of these worship Raya. Stations which distribute Wafers can be found throughout the Nexus and all citizens are legally entitled to a single Wafer each day.
