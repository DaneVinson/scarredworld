# The Feeders
Shortly after cataclysm Life clerics in Nexus realized that there was not enough usable farmland available to support the population. The most powerful of them set upon themselves the task of solving the coming crisis. The city almost fell to starvation and chaos but the Goddess Raya blessed the faithful Life priests with the power to create [Wafers](./poof.md). Since then no citizen of Nexus has had to want for sustinance.

Today the Feeders is a monolithic organization. They're responsible for providing sustencace for the entire population of Nexus and have managed to not only due that but produce a surplus of Poof which is sold to the city's trading partners. The work of actully creating *Poof* is done entirely by Life clerics almost all of whom worship *Raya*.
