Shortly after cataclysm Life Clerics in Nexus realized that there was not enough usable land for the farming and livestock needed to feed population. The most powerful set upon themselves the task of solving the coming crisis. They undertook epic trials and quests and many of the best perished in their attempts. The city almost fell to starvation and chaos. At last hope the Goddess [Raya](./pantheon.md) blessed the remaining faithful Life Clerics with the power to create [Wafers (Poof)](./poof.md). Since then none in the City of Coins has gone hungry. 

The organization that grew to control all production and distribution of Poof named itself *The Benevolent Benefactors*. Everyone else called them the *Feeders*. Today the *Feeders* are a monolithic organization supplying not only the daily Wafers for the citizenry but a surplus to be sold to the city's trade partners.
