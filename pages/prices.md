### True Food and Drink
All True food costs are drastically elevated from those listed in the PH. Typical costs are 100x of the PH listed value for the same item. Example: the PH shows a loaf of bread costs 2 cp, subsequently a loaf of True bread costs 2 gp.

### Poof Spirits
Poof Spirits is the common name for any of the alcoholic-like beverages that are made through distillation or fermentation of Poof. Consumption of Poof Spirits produces intoxication, however, the effect is typically a muted version of that produced by alcohol (True Sprits). The cost of Poof Spirit is the same as listed in the PH for its equivalant. Example: 1 gallon of Poof ale costs 2 sp.
