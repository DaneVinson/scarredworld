In 534 AS the [Chaos Storm](./chaos-storms.md) that created the Southern Wasteland raged for weeks. Its fury was felt over 100 miles away in ^city.NameLink^ where there were earthquakes, rains of both ice and stone and for weeks following horrific supernatural creatures which attacked ^city.Name^ and its inhabitants. In the following years various explorers mapped the edges of the Wasteland finding that it was as close as 120 miles southeast of ^city.Name^ and crossed both the ^sliprun-mountains.NameLink^ and the ^cudgel-mountains.NameLink^. To this day, 200 years later, the Wasteland is a toxic dead zone with little to no life to be found within.
