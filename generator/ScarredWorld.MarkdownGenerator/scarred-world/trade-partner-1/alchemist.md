Very little is known about the history of ^alchemist.Nickname^. There are references to the alchemist  ^alchemist.Name^ in the archives of ^city.NameLink^ from several hundred years before the [Scarring](./scarred-world.md) but of his origins there is nothing. What is known is that he's a powerful arcanist, a master alchemist and a complete recluse hiding away in his magical tower ^trade-partner-1.Name^. From there he sells ^green.NameLink^ and his other potions, ointments and elixirs to anyone that will pay his prices.
