The imposing ^cudgel-mountains.Name^ run north to south over 300 miles east of ^city.NameLink^. With peaks as high at two miles they dwarf the ^sliprun-mountains.NameLink^ in both size and ruggedness. Very little is know about the current state of the range but historical records in ^city.Name^ tell of a large Elven kingdom named Silverest that once lay on the east side of the mountains. Whether that kingdom survived the [Scarring](./scarred-world.md) or not is unknown.
