### Poof Spirits
*Poof Spirits* is the common name for any beverage made from the distillation or fermentation of ^poof.FullNameLink^. Consumption of *Poof Spirits* produces intoxication. However, the effect is typically a muted version of that produced by alcohol (*True Sprits*). The cost of *Poof Spirit* is the same as listed in the PH for its equivalent *True* counterpart. Example: 1 gallon of Poof ale costs 2 Talons.
