Shortly after the [Scarring](./scarred-world.md) Life Clerics of ^city.NameLink^ realized that there was not enough usable land for the farming and livestock needed to feed the city's population. The most powerful of these Clerics set upon themselves the task of solving the coming crisis, undertaking epic trials and deadly quests. Many perished in the attempts and the city nearly fell to starvation and chaos. At last hope the Goddess ^deity-good.NameLink^ blessed the remaining faithful Clerics with the power to create ^poof.NameLink^. Since then none in the City of Coins has gone hungry. 

By necessity an organization arose to control the production and distribution of ^poof.Nickname^. That organization eventually named itself *^feeders.Name^*. Even at the beginning the people called them the *^feeders.Nickname^*.

Today the *^feeders.Nickname^* are a monolithic organization supplying not only the daily Wafers for the citizenry but a surplus to be sold to city trade partners. The organization is large enough to have corruption issues but as a rule its members take their responsibilities very seriously and genuinely strive for the betterment of all peoples.
