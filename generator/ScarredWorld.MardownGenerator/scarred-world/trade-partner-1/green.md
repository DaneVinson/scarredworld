^green.Name^ is a magical elixir produced by ^alchemist.NameLink^. It appears as an dull-green, opaque liquid which is ingested in a dose size of about an ounce. A dose of ^green.Name^ always confers magical abilities to those who drink it. These abilities vary widely but in most cases there are both temporary (days to months) and permanent abilities conferred to the recipient. The one quality that appears universal is the addictive nature of ^green.Name^. Those who ingest ^green.Name^ always suffer some form of withdrawal when the temporary effects start to wear off. Again, the withdrawal symptoms vary widely but they always become more severe with successive doses until a certain dose when the user becomes permanently addicted. Users who reach this level of addiction are easily identified as their eyes turn completely green (commonly referred to as being "greened"). Greened users must continue dosing themselves with ^green.Name^ for the remainder of their lives. Those who fail to do so fall deeper and deeper into depression and eventually die of either suicide or starvation as they loose their will to live.
