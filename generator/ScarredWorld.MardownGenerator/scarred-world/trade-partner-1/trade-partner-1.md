^trade-partner-1.Name^ is a river city a thousand miles North of ^city.NameLink^. Its population of ~50K is entirely controlled by ^alchemist.FullNameLink^.

Long before the cataclysm ^alchemist.Name^ created an impossibly high and thin tower known as The ^trade-partner-1.Name^. After the cataclysm the region's survivors fled to The ^trade-partner-1.Name^ in hope of protection. ^alchemist.Name^ was benevolent, he didn't kill them.

It quickly became apparent that The ^trade-partner-1.Name^ served as exceptional protection from the forces unleashed by the cataclysm. Extra-planar creatures have never been found within 20 miles of ^trade-partner-1.Name^ and in several recorded instances ^chaos-storms.NameLink^ have been seen to change course, going around ^trade-partner-1.Name^. It's obvious to most that ^alchemist.Name^ is the source of these protections.

## Government
No real form of government exists within ^trade-partner-1.Name^. The will of ^alchemist.Name^ is enforced mercilessly but he typically has little concern or regard for the people of ^trade-partner-1.Name^. Unless they get in his way he ignores them.

## Life in the ^trade-partner-1.Name^
Though the people are not threatened by supernatural creatures or random ^chaos-storms.Name^ they survive within a small region of safety. The city is perpetually low on all critical resources. This brings about desperate living conditions. Daily life for many of ^trade-partner-1.Name^ citizens is dominated by the struggle for one more day's food. Many choose ^green.NameLink^.

## Trade
All trade outside ^trade-partner-1.Name^ comes from ^city.Name^. The majority of this is conducted with ^alchemist.Name^ exclusively but some ^merchants.NameLink^ have found working with the citizens of ^trade-partner-1.Name^ can be lucrative.
