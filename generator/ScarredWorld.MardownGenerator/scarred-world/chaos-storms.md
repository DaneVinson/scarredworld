As its name suggests a ^chaos-storms.Name^ is a storm made of pure chaos. They can appear as anything from cyclones to towering thunder-heads miles wide. They may be wildly colored, dark and grey or void black. The one constant is that as a ^chaos-storms.Name^ passes it leaves destruction in its wake. Everything in the path of a storm is utterly un-made leaving the land scoured to a smooth surface of toxic grey sand.
