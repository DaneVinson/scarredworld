As the name suggests ^chaos-storms.Name^ are storms of pure chaos. They can appear as anything from cyclones to towering thunder-heads miles wide. They may be wildly colored, dark and grey or void black. The one constant is that when ^chaos-storms.Name^ pass they leave destruction in their wake. Everything in a storm's path is utterly un-made leaving behind land scoured to a smooth surface of toxic grey sand.
