[Scarred World Index](./index.md)

Seven-hundred years ago some catastrophic event left the world vunerable to random contact with the outer planes. Large portions were wiped away by pure chaos. Much of the rest was populated with supernatural horrors. Today 70% of the world is unnavigable and much of the rest is uninhabitable. Only the most powerful pockets of mortal civilization remain. Characters begin the campaign in one such pocket, ^city.FullNameLink^.
