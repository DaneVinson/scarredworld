[Scarred World Index](./index.md)

Seven-hundred years ago a catastrophic event left the world open to random contact with the outer planes. Large portions were wiped away by pure chaos or populated with supernatural horrors. Today most of the world is unnavigable and much of the rest is uninhabitable. Only the most powerful pockets of mortal civilization remain. Characters begin the campaign in one such pocket, ^city.FullNameLink^.
