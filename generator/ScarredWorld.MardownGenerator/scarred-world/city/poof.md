*Poof* is the common name for the Wafers distributed by the ^feeders.NicknameLink^. Consumption of a single Wafer supplies the equivalent of one day's ration, food and water. By law all citizens and guests of the ^city.MarkdownLink^ are entitled to one Wafer each day.

All *Poof* is created by Life Cleric members of the ^feeders.NicknameLink^. The majority of these worship ^deity-good.MarkdownLink^. Stations distributing the Wafers are plentiful within city walls.
