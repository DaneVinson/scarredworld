## Life in the ^city.Nickname^
The free distribution of ^poof.NicknameLink^ means even the lowliest of people are free from the daily pursuit of food. This liberates all to pursue goals beyond providing for self and family. As a result the majority of ^city.Name^' citizens have some significant skill in at least one art, trade or discipline. Every organization from ^wizards.Name^ to the smallest blacksmith in the ^tradesmen.Name^ is inundated with requests for apprenticeship from well qualified applicants. All structures in the city from the keep to the roof of the lowliest house are soundly constructed and well maintained. Craftsmen, artisans and performers of every stripe exist in multitude and the majority of them are experts in their vocation. Theaters and concert halls are abundant and accessible to all. Truly the people of ^city.Name^ have a good life.

Life in ^city.Name^ would be as a Golden Age if not for two facts. First, everyone understands they're a ^chaos-storms.NameLink^ away from being un-made. Second, ^poof.Nickname^ "satisfies" the need for food and water but it leaves some deeper hunger quite unsatisfied.

## Catacombs
In the first decades after the cataclysm ^chaos-storms.Name^s were much more frequent than today. As a result early survivors commonly took any subterranean refuge available to them. For ^city.Name^ this meant utilizing the ancient burial crypts of the city's noble ancestors. The initial survivors called these crypts home for almost three decades and throughout that time they continued to excavate adding to their underground domain. As the ^chaos-storms.Name^s subsided people naturally left the catacombs for a new life on the surface and over the next decade they're home for a generation was sealed up by proclamation of the first Pentacouncil.

Over the centuries the catacombs of ^city.Name^ have become the domain of the undead. Several intelligent undead lords hold sway over this domain but they share a restless peace with the citizens of ^city.Name^. The undead lords know that if the might of the city were to go against them they would be eradicated. Likewise the powers of ^city.Name^ know they could exterminate the undead entirely but doing so would incur grievous losses. Thus, a form of peace is maintained. The undead mostly confine their activities to the catacombs and the leaders of ^city.Name^ can go on as if the undead do not exist.
