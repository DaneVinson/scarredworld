## Life in the ^city.Nickname^
The free distribution of ^poof.NicknameLink^ means all people are free from the daily need for food. This fact liberated the populace to pursue goals beyond daily provisioning for self and family. As a result the majority of ^city.Name^' citizens have some significant skill in at least one art, trade or discipline. Every organization from ^wizards.NameLink^ to the smallest blacksmith in the ^tradesmen.NameLink^ is inundated with requests for apprenticeship from well qualified applicants. From the walls of the keep to the roof on the lowliest house the entire city is soundly constructed and well maintained. Craftsmen, artisans and performers of every stripe exist in multitude and the majority of them are well skilled in their trade. Theaters and concert halls are abundant and accessible to all. Truly the people of ^city.Name^ have a good life.

Life in ^city.Name^ would be like a golden age if not for two facts. First, everyone understands exactly what the ^chaos-storms.NameLink^ mean. On any day everything could be un-made. Second, ^poof.NicknameLink^ satisfies the need for food and water but it leaves some deeper _hunger_ quite unsatisfied. Individual responses to this _hunger_ vary erratically.

## Trade and Commerce
The flow of money has primacy in the ^city.Nickname^ and any entity conducting commercial trade or commerce within ^city.Name^ must be a licensed member of the ^merchants.Name^. Those found out of compliance will be subject to immediate punishment up to and including ^expulsion.NameLink^.

## Taxes
All monetary transactions within ^city.Name^ are taxed at the rate of 10%. All prices listed in the PH or otherwise should be increased by 10%. Any entity found attempting to avoid this lawful Tax will be subject to immediate punishment up to and including ^expulsion.NameLink^.

## Catacombs
In the first decades after the cataclysm ^chaos-storms.NameLink^ were frequent. Early survivors took any subterranean refuge available to them. For ^city.Name^ this meant utilizing the ancient burial crypts of the city's noble ancestors. The initial survivors called these crypts home for almost three decades and throughout that time they continued to excavate adding to their underground domain. As the early wave of ^chaos-storms.NameLink^ subsided people left the catacombs for a new life on the surface and in the following decades the catacombs were sealed by proclamation of the first *Pentacouncil*.

Over the centuries the catacombs of ^city.Name^ have become the domain of the undead. Several intelligent undead lords came to hold sway over the region and they've held a restless peace with the living of ^city.Name^ for generations. The undead lords know that if the might of the ^city.Name^ were rallied against them they'd be eradicated. Likewise, the lords of ^city.Name^ know they could exterminate the undead entirely but doing so would incur grievous losses. Thus, the undead generally confine their activities to the catacombs and the leaders of ^city.Name^ generally act as if the undead do not exist.
