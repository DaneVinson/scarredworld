# TS4 Contractor Epilogues
TS4 members initial Contracts with Maqamir ended on 5/1/737. Some continued on with Maqamir and others left to pursue their own interests. As the years passed (and with the help of Worley Finnegani's tale telling) their exploits gained notoriety giving members some degree of fame throughout Nexus. The following is commonly known of the Contractors after their time in TS4.

## Akuul (Mike)

## Berrywinkle MacGruder (Andy)
Berrywinkle was not offered a Contract extension. He quickly dove back into the study of Necromancy. He was found conducting experiments on the cadavers of missing citizens and was Expelled from Nexus on 4/15/739. Nothing else is known of him.

## Dr. Orwen (Drew)
Having previously extended his Contract with Maqamir Dr. Orwen's service continued an additional year beyond the 5/1/737 ending of TS4. In this final year he developed a lifestyle and training regimen for total health and wellness. Upon completion of his extended Contract Dr. Orwen purchased a building in East Downs and opened the Nexus Wellness Centre to the public. His renown grew and as years went by some of his senior students opened branches of the Centre in other parts of the city. By the time he died in 792 (110 years old) the system he developed was commonly called "Orwen's Path" and was being practiced by a significant portion of Nexus' population.

## Drann Barro (Collin)
Upon completion of his service Contract Drann was promoted within Maqamir to the position of Principal Curator. Shortly after he was known to have left for Spire with a small detail of Contractors. On his return three years later he resumed his life in Nexus. Nothing is known of the time he was away. In 740 Drann was promoted to Maqamir's Chief Business Strategist (Board seat). Drann continued in that esteemed position for the remainder of his professional life. He died in his Silver Line home shortly after. 

## Grym (Dan)

## Halflong (Andy)
After stepping into the abyss in Contract 7 Halflong was a changed halfling. He developed an intense fascination with the idea traveling to other planes. He often spoke of these desires with other TS4 members (several of whom tried to dissuade him of this interest). When Halfong was not offered a Contract extension he focused on his fascination with vigor. He was last seen by Worley just months after the Contract ended. Worley reported him as exuberant and excited about the near future. Nothing more is know of him.

## Renard Finnegani (Todd)

## Sylcros Tattersoul (Dan)

## Tall Paul Thunderhill (Collin)
At the end of his Contract Tall Paul was not offered an extension. A few months later he led a group of halflings on a quest to reach Pleasant Valley where they intended to make a new home. Many died on the way but Tall Paul was not among them. Over the years reports reached Nexus that he was thriving in his new life and that ultimately he was named Warden Thunderhill, Protector of the Valley.

## Togrian the Survivor (Mike)

## Tycho Phandrel (Drew)
At the end of the Contract Maqamir offered Tycho an appointment as Master of Arcane Research and Tycho accepted ending his adventuring days forever. He purchased TS4's __Astromancy Archive__ and Maqamir provided him with the remains of the Fallen Star which he continued to study in the hopes of one day using it to create a divination relic called the __Guiding Star__. Eventually his role in locating the Fallen Star became public knowledge and Tycho became revered within the divination circles of Magnus Arcana.

## Worley Finnegani (Todd)
