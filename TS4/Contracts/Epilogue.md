# TS4 Contractor Epilogues
TS4 members initial Contracts with Maqamir ended on 5/1/737. Some continued on with Maqamir and others left to pursue their own interests. As the years passed (and with the help of Worley Finnegani's tale telling) their exploits gained notoriety giving members some degree of fame throughout Nexus. The following is commonly known of the Contractors after their time in TS4.

## Akuul (Mike)

## Berrywinkle MacGruder (Andy)

## Dr. Orwen (Drew)
Having previously extended his Contract with Maqamir Dr. Orwen's service continued an additional year beyond the 5/1/737 ending of TS4. In this final year he developed a lifestyle and training regimen for total health and wellness. Upon completion of his extended Contract Dr. Orwen purchased a building in East Downs and opened the Nexus Wellness Centre to the public. His renown grew and as years went by some of his senior students opened branches of the Centre in other parts of the city. By the time he died in 792 (110 years old) the system he developed was commonly called "Orwen's Path" and was being practiced by a significant portion of Nexus' population.

## Drann Barro (Collin)

## Grym (Dan)

## Halflong (Andy)

## Renard Finnegani (Todd)

## Sylcros Tattersoul (Dan)

## Tall Paul Thunderhill (Collin)

## Togrian the Survivor (Mike)

## Tycho Phandrel (Drew)
At the end of the Contract Maqamir offered Tycho an appointment as Master of Arcane Research and Tycho accepted ending his adventuring days forever. He purchased TS4's __Astromancy Archive__ and Maqamir provided him with the remains of the Fallen Star which he continued to study in the hopes of one day using it to create a divination relic called the __Guiding Star__. Eventually his role in locating the Fallen Star became public knowledge and Tycho became revered within the divination circles of Magnus Arcana.
