* 12/22 Noon - Contractors turned due east and entered Verman's Path
* 12/22 3:00 PM - Contractors located a grassy circle 100' in radius a few miles inside of Verman's Path. Sparse grasses at the edges increased in density moving toward the center where thick, lush grasses grew. Clearly visible in the center was an impact crater ~4' feet in diameter.

It used Lighting Breath (dropping Tycho) then dove back into it's tunnel. Tall Paul, believing Halflong was still inside the creature, dove down the tunnel after it. Grym followed sliding down the tube glaive blade first splitting the creature open from behind. Tall Paul continued to look through the viscera until he discovered Halflong was safe above
