# Contract 4 - Rocks (Success)

## Pre-contract (9/735 - 2/736)
* The five members of the [Radiant Arms](https://github.com/DaneVinson/scarredworld/blob/master/markdown/paladins.md) pursuing the Pit Fiend left 9/735. According to the [Benevolent Benefactors](https://github.com/DaneVinson/scarredworld/blob/master/markdown/feeders.md) at least one of the Arms "no longer exists on this plane". The Paladins that left would have easily defeated a lone Pit Fiend.
* The Contractor group "Steel Wardens" was sent to the Halfling Valley to continue trade. They returned 12/3 and their contract was both successful and lucrative (though 3 of 7 contractors did not return). As the founding Contractor group TS4 received 1% of the profits, 834 Crowns.
* [Lord Roth](https://github.com/DaneVinson/scarredworld/blob/master/markdown/vampire-paladin.md) left Nexus 12/17 with the intention of dueling Lord Kaamaz, in his lair, on the winter solstice. There's been no word of him since.

## Objectives
* Locate an island ~1000 nautical miles southwest of Nexus as indicated by a map from before the Scarring.
* Look for evidence of mining on the island.
* Investigate the potential of re-opening the mine.

## Intelligence
* [Maqamir](https://github.com/DaneVinson/scarredworld/blob/master/markdown/company.md) had recently acquired documents from before the Scarring. Among them was a set of ledgers showing the operation of a lucrative diamond mine. Also found was a map showing a small island ~1000 nautical miles southwest of Nexus labeled as the mine itself.
* Prior to the Contract start Dr. Orwen and Worley Finnegani underwent two months of intensive training in geology and mining administered by Mine Master Gruntel Rocksniffer (Dwarf).
* The ship Whipline was contracted to take TS4 members to the location of the island shown on the map (~10 days travel). Whipline was manned by Captain Strom, the First Mate Loni Barbtongue and a dozen crew. If and when the island was located the Captain was to attempt to put TS4 ashore. If TS4 did not make contact within two days he was to return to Nexus and debrief.
* The potential for Spoils was unknown.

## Timeline
* 9/6/735, Nexus - Completion of Contract 3 (Pleasant Valley)
* 2/4/736, Maqamir headquarters - Terramis Squeebus briefs TS4 on Contract 4 (Rocks)
* 2/5, Aboard Whipline - TS4 members locate the sailing ship Whipline in the harbor of Nexus and set sail in search of the island. The day presented light winds and Whipline made moderate progress.
* 2/6-2/10, Aboard Whipline - Light and medium winds. No additional complications.
* 2/11, Aboard Whipline - A Chaos Storm was spotted early in the afternoon. The large storm blocked the Whipline's path and appeared to be moving closer. Captain Strom turned the Whipline about and employed an Air Elemental bound to her to produce gail-force winds into the sails. The Whipline speed out of danger quickly but the day was lost to evasive actions.
* 2/12, Aboard Whipline - Medium winds and good travel distance helped to make up for time lost evading the Chaos Storm.
* 2/13, Aboard Whipline - Another Chaos Storm was spotted though this one was far in the distance and moving away.
* 2/14, Aboard Whipline - Winds began to fall off in the morning and continued to do. The ship was becalmed by mid-afternoon and remained so through the night. Early in the evening the ship was attacked by several Ice Mephits who were dispatched without loss of crew.
* 2/15, Aboard Whipline - The island was located exactly as the map indicated. At first sight it appeared as a rock dome approximately a half mile in diameter and 150' high. The characteristic gray color of Wasteland indicated it had been swept over many times by Chaos Storms. Captain Strom decided to sail completely around the island before deciding how to proceed. This exploration showed a ship wrecked against the rocks on the west side and a small bay at the south which appeared to contain a seawall carved out of the rock at its interior. The remainder of the island met the sea with 60' or higher rock cliffs.
  * The Contractors decided to investigate the shipwreck. Captain Strom gave them use of a __Folding Boat__ and two sailors to pilot them to the wreckage. The __Water Breathing__ scroll provided my Maqamir was used. The Contractors discovered 5 Zombies (which were easily destroyed), 13,000 Crowns worth of uncut diamonds in the hold and 900 Crowns of loose gems and a log in the captain's quarters. The log showed the ship to be the Driftfit out of Nexus. The logs last entry was dated 7/18/721.
  * Captain Strom anchored the Whipline in the bay ~200 yards from the previously discovered seawall. Once again using Captain Strom's __Folding Boat__ the Contractors approached the 20' high wall which was clearly hand carved out of the island's rock. Above was found a large, two-tiered platform with 40' high stairs connecting the top and bottom tiers and small cave entrances on both ends of the top level. Like the seawall the entire structure was hand carved from the bedrock. The Contractors surmised this was likely a dock and cargo loading area in the past. On approach a human female was seen at the entrance of one of the caves. She quickly disappeared into the cave but several Contractors felt there was something odd about her.
  * The Contractors came to a stop along the seawall and used a __Rope Trick__ spell to ascend to the top. As Contractors were climbing the rope the group was attacked from the water by a Giant Coral Snake. A short fight ensued and the Snake was slain with little damage done.
  * The Contractors gained the first level and began up the stairs. When the first of the group were near the top they were set upon by 3 Yuan-ti Broodguard and the woman seen previously, a Yuan-ti Pureblood. The Contractors disposed of the Broodguard in short order and the Pureblood retreated back into the "cave", the entrance of the mine they were searching for.
  * Several Contractors employed Light and the group moved into the mine after the Pureblood. They shortly encountered a swarm of poisonous snakes which they eradicated with little more than annoyance. This repeated a half dozen times during the Contractors exploration of the mine.
  * As the Contractors moved through the mine they discovered it had several branches and moved up and down apparently following veins of diamond. Tycho and Worley confirmed the tunnels were consistent with mining operations but it appeared the miners of old had tapped out the treasure once held in the rock. Several of the lower mineshafts dropped below the sea level and were flooded. Using their previously cast __Water Breathing__ they were able to explore these flooded sections as well.
  * During the exploration of the lower mineshafts the Contractors found a room that was clearly carved out of the bedrock after the creation of the shaft that lead to it. The room was on the other side of a flooded section and was the home to a Yuan-ti Night Whisperer  and two female Purebloods. The Contractors fought a pitched battle wounding several of them grievously before they killed their foes.
  * In a second lower shaft, also beyond a flooded area the Contractors found a Yuan-ti nursery which had 56 eggs and 4 Broodguards. They killed the Broodguards taking only minor wounds and then destroyed the eggs.
  * Past the nursery, in another submerged tunnel the Contractors discovered the Yuan-ti's treasury.
  * While exploring a mineshaft in the upper area of the mine the Contractors again entered a large room which had clearly been carved after the original mine. The room had 4 large pillars, the walls were adorned with paintings of snakes, scantily clad women and all manner of debauchers and the floor was covered in pillows, cushions and leisure furniture. The leasure room was home to 2 Yuan-ti Malisons (Type-1), 2 Broodguards and 4 Purebloods (one of whom was the female encountered at the entrance who'd fled). A pitched battle ensued and several Contractors were dropped. The Yuan-ti were defeated by the slimmest of margins.
  * The Contractors retreated to the Whipline to rest and recover.
* 2/16, Aboard the Whipline - The Contractors were ferried back to the landing platform and continued exploring the mine.
  * Again in the upper tunnels the Contractors found another newly carved room. This one had a 50' vaulted celling, 4 pillars and walls covered in paintings of serpents striking, crushing or eating their victims. In the center of the room was the statue of a giant snake. This alter room was occupied by a Yuan-ti Pitmaster and 2 Pureblood who attacked immediately. The foes fought viciously and several Contractors were moderately wounded but they were well rested and had prepared well ultimately defeating their opponents.
  * At the end of the final searched mineshaft Tycho and Worley easily identified an un-mined vein of diamonds.
  * The Contractors returned to the Whipline and set sail back to Nexus.
* 2/17-2/24 - Favorable winds and clear weather made the return trip easy and relatively short.
