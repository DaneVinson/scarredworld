# Contract 2 - Catch a Thief (Success)

## Objective and Intelligence
Catch and return a thief who stole two magic items and three valuable mundane items from the client.

The target was identified as a Necromancer named Kraydus. He stole the named items from the client a little over a month before TS4 members were presented with the contract. The contract stipulates that Kraydus and each of the items should be returned and that compensation would be paid independently for each. Kraydus' location had been determined (through a separate contract) to be in close proximity to the [Northern Occlusion](https://github.com/DaneVinson/scarredworld/blob/master/markdown/northern-occlusion.md). A boat named Sea Sparrow, captained by a Dwarf named Strom, was hired to take the Contractors to within 20 miles of the Occlusion (as close as any captain would go). There the Contractors would be put ashore to complete the journey on foot. The Sparrow was hired to wait up to a maximum of 48 hours for the Contractor's return.

## Day 1 (7/16)
Contractors boarded the keelboat Sea Sparrow and set out from Nexus. Conditions were favorable and travel went smoothly. During the first night the ship was attacked by what was later identified as a Shadow Demon. Grym was on watch in the crow's nest when he saw the creature take one of the deck-hands over the rail. A few moments later the creature materialized through the deck and attacked those around him. The battle was short and the Contractors vanquished the demon taking little damage themselves.

## Day 2
After making good time on the trip the Sea Sparrow dropped the Contractors on the beach approximately 20 miles from the edge of the Northern Occlusion in the afternoon of the second day. Even at this range the Occlusion was very ominous and frightening, feelings that only got worse as the Contractors moved closer. The Sparrow moved away from the shore preparing to wait 48 hours for the Contractors return.

The Contractors moved North along the coast toward the last known location of the thief Kraydus. Near dusk they were attacked by a dozen Lemure Devils and an Imp armed with a __Wand of Magic Missiles__ who came from the direction of the Occlusion. The Contractors fought a pitched battle eliminating all the foes while only taking a few wounds themselves.
