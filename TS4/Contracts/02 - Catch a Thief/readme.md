# Contract 2 - Catch a Thief (Success)

## Objective and Intelligence
Catch and return a thief who stole two magic items and three valuable mundane items from the client.

The target was identified as a Necromancer named Kraydus. He stole the named items from the client a little over a month before TS4 members were presented with the contract. The contract stipulates that Kraydus and each of the items should be returned and that compensation would be paid independently for each. Kraydus' location had been determined (through a separate contract) to be in close proximity to the [Northern Occlusion](https://github.com/DaneVinson/scarredworld/blob/master/markdown/northern-occlusion.md). A boat named Sea Sparrow, captained by a Dwarf named Strom, was hired to take the Contractors to within 20 miles of the Occlusion (as close as any captain would go). There the Contractors would be put ashore to complete the journey on foot. The Sparrow was hired to wait up to a maximum of 48 hours for the Contractor's return.

## Day 1 (7/16)
Contractors boarded the keelboat Sea Sparrow and set out from Nexus. Conditions were favorable and travel went smoothly. During the first night the ship was attacked by what was later identified as a Shadow Demon. Grym was on watch in the crow's nest when he saw the creature take one of the deck-hands over the rail. A few moments later the creature materialized through the deck and attacked those around him. The battle was short and the Contractors vanquished the demon taking little damage themselves.

## Day 2
With favorable winds and relatively calm seas the Sea Sparrow dropped the Contractors on the beach approximately 20 miles from the edge of the Northern Occlusion in the afternoon of the second day. At this range the Occlusion was ominous and menacing, feelings which only worsened as the Contractors moved closer. The Sparrow moved away from the shore preparing to wait the agreed upon 48 hours for the Contractors return.

The Contractors moved North along the coast toward the last known location of the thief Kraydus. At dusk they were within a couple miles of the Occlusion when they  were attacked by a dozen Lemure Devils and an Imp armed with a __Wand of Magic Missiles__. The Contractors fought a pitched battle eliminating all the foes while only taking minor wounds themselves.

As darkness fell the Contractors shifted to traveling East in search of their target. After an hour Tycho found the entrance to an old mine on a gently sloping hill. It was in disrepair and looked dangerously close to collapse. The Contractors pressed on into the mineshaft, single file.

As the Contractors explored the mine they encountered a small group of Zombies then three Ghouls. All these they dispatched easily. Next, they came upon a larger group of Zombies. They began as before but were attacked through a side mineshaft by a second group of Zombies and a human that could only be their Target. As the second group of Zombies attacked Kraydus, couched upside down on the celling, placed a Sleep spell on Tall Paul then retreated down the shaft. Shortly after came his scream. As the Contractors continued their engagement with the Zombies a Death Knight emerged from the shaft dragging a limp Kraydus behind him. He waved a hand and all the Zombies dropped. He threw the limp body towards the nearest Contractor and said "This one much overplayed his position". He identified himself as Lord Kaamaz and said he would not be the one to break the truce with Nexus. He allowed the Contractors to take the still living Kraydus but kept the Elven Dagger for himself. He bid the Contractors to leave his domain and in parting said "Tell your [Lord Roth](../../../markdown/vampire-paladin.md) that Lord Kaamaz is at his service."

The remaining stolen items were discovered on Kraydus along with: 
* __Bracers of Defense__
* 10x diamond, 100 Crows
* Emerald ring, 800 Crowns

The Contractors retreated toward the surface and withing sight of the exit, illuminated by lightning flashes from the Occlusion, they encountered the Mist. The front was close to the entrance so the Contractors decided to run through the Mist in the mineshaft and then escape it by moving South once out.
