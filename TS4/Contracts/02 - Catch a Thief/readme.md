# Contract 2 - Catch a Thief (Success)

## Objective and Intelligence
Catch and return a thief who stole two magic items and three valuable mundane items from the client.

The target was identified as a Necromancer named Kraydus. He stole the named items from the client a little over a month before TS4 members were presented with the contract. The contract stipulates that Kraydus and each of the items should be returned and that compensation would be paid independently for each. Kraydus' location had been determined (through a separate contract) to be in close proximity to the [Northern Occlusion](https://github.com/DaneVinson/scarredworld/blob/master/markdown/northern-occlusion.md). A boat named Sea Sparrow, captained by a Dwarf named Strom, was hired to take the Contractors to within 20 miles of the Occlusion (as close as any captain would go). There the Contractors would be put ashore to complete the journey on foot. The Sparrow was hired to wait up to a maximum of 48 hours for the Contractor's return.

## Day 1 (7/16)
Contractors boarded the keelboat Sea Sparrow and set out from Nexus. Conditions were favorable and travel went smoothly. During the first night the ship was attacked by a Shadow Demon. Grym was on watch in the crow's nest when he saw the creature take one of the deck-hands over the rail. A few moments later the creature materialized through the deck and attacked those around him. The battle was short and the Contractors vanquished the demon taking little damage themselves.

## Day 2
With favorable winds and relatively calm seas the Sea Sparrow dropped the Contractors on the beach approximately 20 miles from the edge of the Northern Occlusion in the afternoon of the second day. At this range the Occlusion was ominous and menacing, feelings which only worsened as the Contractors moved closer. The Sparrow moved away from the shore preparing to wait the agreed upon 48 hours for the Contractors' return.

The Contractors moved North along the coast toward the last known location of the thief Kraydus. At dusk they were within a couple miles of the Occlusion when they  were attacked by a dozen Lemure Devils and an Imp armed with a __Wand of Magic Missiles__. The Contractors fought a pitched battle eliminating all the foes while taking only minor wounds themselves.

As darkness fell the Contractors shifted to traveling East in search of their target. After an hour Tycho found the entrance to an old mine on a gently sloping hill. It was in disrepair and looked dangerously close to collapse. The Contractors pressed on into the mineshaft, single file.

As the Contractors explored the mine they encountered a small group of Zombies then three Ghouls. All these they dispatched easily. Next, they came upon a larger group of Zombies. They began as before but were attacked through a side mineshaft by a second group of Zombies and a human that could only be their Target. As the Zombies attacked Kraydus was couched upside down on the celling. From there he dropped a Sleep spell on Tall Paul and retreated back down the shaft. Shortly after came his scream. As the Contractors continued their engagement with the Zombies a Death Knight emerged from the shaft dragging a limp Kraydus behind him. He waved a hand and all the Zombies dropped. He threw the limp body towards the nearest Contractor and said "This one much overplayed his position". He identified himself as Lord Kaamaz and said he would not be the one to break the truce with Nexus. He allowed the Contractors to take the still living Kraydus but kept the Elven Dagger for himself. He bid the Contractors to leave his domain and in parting said "Tell your [Lord Roth](../../../markdown/vampire-paladin.md) that Lord Kaamaz is at his service whenever he wishes."

Kraydus was found to have the rest of the stolen items as well as: 
* __Bracers of Defense__
* 10x diamond, 100 Crows
* Emerald ring, 800 Crowns

The Contractors retreated toward the surface. Within sight of the exit, illuminated by lightning flashes from the Occlusion, they encountered the Mist. The edge of the Mist was close to the entrance so the Contractors decided to run through to the outside, then South as quickly as possible. They escaped the Mist within seconds but not before most Contractors had suffered poison damage and the Poisoned condition. Additionally, several Contractors suffered from Confusion. Once they'd distanced themselves from the Mist the Contractors stopped briefly to cure wounds and Poisonings.

## Day 3
As the sun broke on the third day the Contractors all suffered a level of Exhaustion as they'd had no significant rest since they left the Sea Sparrow.

In the late morning the Contractors were attacked by a Bulezau Demon which sprang into their midst from a thicket. The Demon was fearsome in its attack but once again the Contractors worked well as a unit and dispatched their foe without significant injuries.

As evening approached the Contractors arrived at the rendezvous point to find the Sea Sparrow waiting just off the shore. They boarded and the ship set off on the return voyage to Nexus.

## Day 4
After an uneventful night of travel the Contractors started the fourth day rested and well on their way back to Nexus. 

In the afternoon they first caught sight of flames in the sky many miles behind them. It was slowly moving closer. Within an hour a Nightmare attacked the Sparrow. The Fiend went down quickly. With the final blow Grym split it open and fiery entrails burst onto the ship. Akuul easily put out the flames. 

As night fell the Sparrow delivered the Contractors back to Nexus.
