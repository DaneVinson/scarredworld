Four Githyanki warriors used __Misty Step__ to board the Whipeline intending to cripple it. The Contractors killed them but grievous wounds were taken in turn. The Basul was attacked by 2 sloops. They did not fair as well. As the Whipline's Elemental powered up the Contractors watched a huge Githyanki sailing ship overtake the Barsul. No one has any question of its fate.
