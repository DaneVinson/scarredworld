## Timeline (4/3/736 - 4/14/736)
* 4/3 - Strom's plan and first day sailing
  * Through an elaborate roose (that Contractors were made part of) Captain Strom set up the ship The Barsul as a sacrificial shield against the dangers of the southern run
  * Traveled 100 miles with favorable winds
* 4/4 - No encounters, traveled 100 miles with favorable winds
* 4/5 - No encounters, traveled 100 miles with favorable winds
* 4/6 - Attack by Githyanki raiders
  * Githyanki sloops attacked the Whipeline and Barsul mid-day. A sloop closed on the Whipline as Capaintain Strom prepared to deploy the Air Elemental. Four Githyanki warriors used __Misty Step__ to board the Whipeline intending to cripple it. The Contractors killed them but grievous wounds were taken in turn. The Basul was attacked by 2 sloops. They did not fair as well. As the Whipline's Elemental powered up the Contractors watched a huge Githyanki sailing ship overtake the Barsul. No one has any question of its fate.
  * Traveled 150 miles mostly using Whipeline's Air Elemental
* 4/7 - Arrival at Whipline's drop-point 
  * By late afternoon there is heavy rain, winds and lightning (a bolt hits the ship)
  * Late in the evening Whipline arrives at a sheltered bay inside Spire's protection approximately 20 miles from Spire 
  * Captain Strom told the Contractors he would wait in the bay for up to one week
  * Contractors rested for the night
* 4/8 - Travel to Spire
  * Mid-day on their travel to Spire the Contractors were attacked by a Wyvern. It made a single pass bitting Grym and striking him with its poison tail and was then killed by the concentrated attacks of the Contractors before it could fly away.
  * The Contractors arrived at Spire late in the afternoon and were greeted at the hill Spire rests on by the Meister's Factor the Greened Gnome Svenstar.
  * The Contractors turned over the merchandise and received 100 vials of __The Green__.
  * The Contractors were fed more True Food than they'd ever seen. All Contractors but Grym partook of the food and most gained some magical enhancement in so doing.
  * The Contractors were provided individual rooms in the Spire where they stayed for the night.
* 4/9 - Travel back to the Whipline
  * The Contractors are treated to a breakfast of excellent True Food (no magical effects this time) before departing Spire
  * In the late afternoon the Contractors encounter a group of bandits. Their leader, a Greened human, identifies himself as Jerrit Alexander and he demands some of __The Green__ the Contractors are carrying. They of course refuse and combat ensues. Despite Alexander's incredible regeneration ability and another of the bandit's Green ability (Wild Shape) the bandits are quickly defeated and Alexander uses __Fly__ to make his escape.
  * The Contractors reach the Whipline near dusk.
* 4/10 - No encounters, traveled 100 miles with favorable winds

* 4/14 - The Whipline arrives in Nexus mid-day. The Contractors deliver the case of 100 viles of __The Green__ to Maqamir headquarters where Master Assessor Terramis Squeebus takes possession. Contractors are debriefed and then released of duties for the next week.
