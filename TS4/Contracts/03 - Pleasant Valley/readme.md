# Contract 3 - Pleasant Valley (Success)

## Objective and Intelligence
Two nights before TS4's initial briefing the Ranger Farstep completed a contract for Maqamir. He reported seeing manicured rows of grapes just past the well hidden entrance to a valley. He was in haste and did not investigate further.

Farstep understood the potential of his discovery and marked the location with an enchanted iron coin magically joined to a twin which he sold to Maqamir. He placed this coin exactly 1000 yards due west of the valley opening. Its twin indicated this to be precisely 192 miles Northeast.

TS4 was to investigate the valley, make friendly contact with its inhabitants, barter to acquire True food and open a path to long-term trade.

## Preparation (8/20/735)
TS4 selected active contractors
* Sylcros Tattersoul (Dan)
* Tograin the Survivor (Mike)
* Renard Finnegani (Todd)
* Dr. Orwen (Drew)
* Halflong (Andy)
* Drann Barro (Collin)

Issued equipment
* 5k Crowns worth of 100 Crown diamonds
* __Chest of Preserving__
* 4x __Potion of Healing__
* 2x Vial of Holy Water
* 2x __Scroll Lesser Restoration__
* 2x __Scroll Protection from Evil__
* 4 mules
* 4 weeks rations (28 poof wafers) per party member (or mule)

## Travel Plan
The magical coin provided by Farstep showed the location of it's twin at the base of the [Sliprun Mountains](../../../markdown/sliprun-mountains.md), just north of the to the norther fork of the [Menalay River](../../../markdown/menalay-river.md) ([Map](../../Images/nexus_local_area.jpg) #3). TS4 decided to travel along the River as far as possible turning north only for the last half day. Contractors had crossed [Verman's Path](../../../markdown/vermans-path.md) in during TS4's maiden Contract so the decision was made to travel through it again saving a half-day of travel each way. Expected travel time to the target was 8 days.

  * Travel: In the morning a small [Chaos Storm](../../../markdown/chaos-storms.md) was observed coming over the mountains to the east. Its initial path was directly towards the TS4. The Storm's path changed several times through the day sometimes looking as if it would pass harmlessly and sometimes again heading in towards the group. A few hours before day's end it finally headed east back over the mountains and out of sight.

  * Travel: Near the end of the day TS4 located Farstep's magical coin but after moving 1000 yards east of its location there was no sign of the described valley. After an hour searching Dr. Orwen's keen perception noted an odd looking game trail. He followed it a few steps and found it opened suddenly into a large valley. As described by Farstep the valley did indeed contain rows of manicured grapevines. On entry the contractors noticed a thin line of obsidian embedded in the ground and a 12' tall plain featured statue across the line. Upon crossing all contractors had the distinct feeling that the statue was watching them. They also noted that the air, soil and vegetation were all markedly healthier and more vibrant on the valley side of the line. Dr. Orwen quickly noticed the group was being watched by a small halfling (later identified as Jory Quicktoes) standing in the grapes a couple hundred yards away. Upon being noticed he disappeared into the vines at an amazing pace. The contractors begin moving into the valley which they discovered was filled with agriculture. Within a short time they were met by a gruff weathered halfling who identified himself as Sheriff Jasper Thornspeak. The Sheriff suggested the contractors should leave the valley but when they refused he reluctantly lead them to a plaza at the center of the valley. There they met with members of a Council including the Sheriff, Big Bee the Mayor and Sas Buttercup the head of the farmers co-op. The contractors were made welcome and invited to stay at least a day.
  * Rest: Peaceful in the plaza
* 8/29: Contractors spent the day talking with inhabitants of the Valley, acquiring information and negotiating for goods. By the end of the day several bottles each of brandy and wine were procured from Quiv the Casker. Late in the day Laan Bestwater, Owner/operator of The Honeyed Mug, told the contractors that there was a known nest of Cave Fishers near the Valley. If the contractors would kill and return the creatures he's match their weight in the produce of TS4's choice. The contractors decided to pursue the deal.
* 8/30
  * Travel: At sunrise Jory Quicktoes led the contractors west out the Valley then northeast into rocky terrain. Within a couple hours he pointed out a cave as the home of Cave Fishers. The contractors entered the cave finding two of the beasts which they slew easily. Searching through the cave's stagnant pond the contractors discovered a __+1 Longbow__, 5x __Unbreakable Arrows__ and a __Rod of Retribution__. Jory led the contractors back to the Valley. The contractors arrived at the plaza late in the afternoon with 400 pounds of King Fisher meat. Making good on his end Laan Bestwater provided 200 pounds of berries and 200 pounds of nuts.
  * Rest: The Halflings of the Valley had a large party featuring the Cave Fisher meat. Contractors enjoyed free food and drink in the plaza with hundreds of celebrating Halflings. The feast started immediately upon the contractor's return and ran long into the night. All the participants were favorably disposed towards the contractors.
