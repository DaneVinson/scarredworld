# Contract 3 - Pleasant Valley (Success)

## Objective and Intelligence
Two nights before TS4 was briefed on the the Ranger Farstep completed a contract for Maqamir. During his debrief he reported seeing manicured rows of grapes just past the well hidden entrance to a valley. He was in haste and did not investigate further.

Farstep understood the potential of his discovery and marked the location with an enchanted iron coin magically joined to a twin which he sold to Maqamir. He placed this coin exactly 1000 yards due West of the valley opening. Its twin indicated this to be precisely 192 miles Northeast. 

TS4 was to investigate the valley, make contact with any inhabitants and barter to acquire any available True food with as profitable margins as possible. Establish long-term trade agreements if possible.
