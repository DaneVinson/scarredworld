# Contract 6 - Crypt Run (Success)

## Pre-contract (4/15/736-6/20/736)
* Contract 5 was completed 4/14/736
* [Maqamir](../../markdown/company.md) pays the Contractors 2 month's salary, benefits and bonuses as agreed with each
* First TS4 bonus from Diamond Dome is 1378 Crowns (114/Contractor) 
* Another trip to Happy Valley returned a bonus of 945 Crowns to TS4 (78/Contractor)

## Objectives from Master Assessor (6/20/736)
In the Catacombs is the crypt of an ancient and benevolent undead spirit. Recent information indicated [Lord Roth](../../markdown/vampire-paladin.md)'s long lost holy sword Gimjeer might be found there. The Contractors were to follow the hired guide Lazarus through the crypts of old [Nexus](../../markdown/city.md) and into the Catacombs below, locate the crypt, retrieve Gimjeer and return it to Nexus so it might be returned to Lord Roth (for a presumed substantial reward).

Several Contractors were struck by the fact that there was no mention of Lazarus leading the Contractors back to Nexus. Akuul and Tycho both understood this meant navigating the Catacombs on the return trip and so applied their skills in planing for this reality.

## Timeline (6/22/736)
* 6:00 AM, Nexus: The Contractors entered the crypts of Nexus through a small Maqamir owned building in the merchant district. In the basement of the tiny pub Lost Things (famous for Knock You Out Stout) has an entrance to the crypts. Through the trek Lazarus ranged ahead at a supernatural speed. He would frequently return to warn them of small groups of Skeletons and/or Zombies which the Contractors easily destroyed, generally taking no damage themselves.
* ~6:30 AM, Nexus crypts, 2nd level: The Contractors were attacked by a group of Zombies including 2 Greater Zombies. These were dispatched without great effort though a bit of damage.
* ~7:30 AM, Nexus crypts, 4th level: The Contractors encountered 2 Flameskulls in an open family crypt. Luckily both were dispatched before they could unleash their deadly spells.
* ~8:30 AM, Catacombs: The Contractors were attacked by an Umber Hulk which broke through the wall behind them taking the group by surprise. Its gaze caused two Contractors to attack their fellows. Then it viciously attacked several others before it was slain.
* ~10:30 AM, Catacombs: The Contractors reached the Spirit's crypt.
  * The door was covered by a large pile of debris and a brick wall. It took approximately 2 hours to clear and during that time Lazarus disappeared.
  * Upon opening the the Crypt's door the Contractors beheld a large square room with a dozen pillars and a vaulted ceiling. At the far end of the room a large stone sarcophagus sat atop a 3 stepped dias and on the wall behind hung a greatsword, seemingly untouched by the centuries it had been there. Clearly this was Gimjeer. 
  * Immediately all the dust in the room swirled towards the dias to form airy visage of an elderly human male. As soon as the spirit took form Akuul was overtaken with fear and fled back into the Catacombs (he overcame his fear after a short distance but wisely remained back from the crypt door).
  * The spirit spoke, "I have seen no mortals in many lifetimes and I sense no evil in you. For what purpose have you disturbed my rest?" The Contractors told the spirit they were attempting to return Gimjeer to Lord Roth. The spirit responded "Your intent is true and your purpose is noble. You may take the blade. Give the young Lord my regards."
  * Grym moved to take Gimjeer. Upon touch he became aware the weapon was sentient, Lawful Good, very powerful and pleased to be in the hands of a mortal of like temperament.
  * Over the following few minutes The dust forming the spirit's visage slowly floated away. In that time it seemed to watch the Contractors with disinterest. It only spoke when questioned and its responses were short and meaningless.
  * The Contractors made judicious use of 2 __Catnap__ spells and each Contractor gained the benefit of a Short Rest. Additionally, Grym Attuned with Gimjeer.
* ~1:00 PM, Catacombs: The Contractors left the spirit's Crypt for Nexus
* ~1:30 PM, Catacombs: The Contractors were attacked by Wights firing arrows from the darkness. As they closed into combat the 4 Wights engaged with their longswords. Shortly after 2 additional Wights attacked the back of the Contractor's ranks. In the pitched battle several contractors were grievously wounded before the Wights were destroyed. The group of Wights carried 2 __+1 Longswords__ and a __+1 Longbow__.
* ~2:30 PM, Catacombs: In a small natural cave the Contractors were attacked by several Zombies. As they engaged a Banshee materialized through the celling and emitted its Wail. Most contractors resisted the evil magic but Tall Paul succumbed and was dropped. As the battle began the two previously encountered Flameskulls appeared from behind and threw Fireballs as the group. The battle was close and several Contractors were taken right to the edge but they ultimately prevailed. Following Akuul's instructions __Dispel Magic__ was cast upon the remains of the Flameskulls destroying them permanently. The group spend several minutes administering healing to those worst wounded before continuing.
* ~3:00 PM, Nexus crypts, 2rd level: While walking the causeway of the 2nd level of Nexus' crypts a __Lightning Bolt__ suddenly erupted from behind a pile of rubble ahead and flashed through the group wounding several Contractors. During the flash of light a Vampire Spawn was seen hiding being the rubble wielding the Wand. Beside him stood another and a third was seen hanging upside down on the ceiling. Gimjeer made Grym aware that it could generate a __Sunlight__ spell but when activated the Vampire Spawn did not flee as expected. Instead they held their ground and fought despite taking constant damage from the light. Gimjeer indicated that the Vampire Spawn's master was nearby but feared the __Sunlight__ so forced his Spawn to stay and fight in his stead. In the battle 2 more __Lightning Boltls__ were released and Grym was dropped right before the last Vampire Spawn was killed. Before the Vampire could move to attack the group Grym was healed enough to activate the last of Gimjeer's __Sunlight__ spells. The Contractors decide to exhaust themselves in a full speed dash to the exit in hopes they would make it before the __Sunlight__ ended and the Vampire could attack.
* 3:28 PM, Broken Things, Nexus: A Wraith joined the Vampire in stalking the Contractors as they dashed for the exit but it too was impotent against Gimjeer's __Sunlight__. They both raged as the Contractors returned to the safety of Nexus.
