# Contract 7 - Return to Pleasant Valley (Success)

## Pre-contract (6/23/736 - 9/16/736)
* Contract 6 (Crypt Run) was completed 6/22/736
* [Maqamir](../../markdown/company.md) pays the Contractors 3 month's salary, benefits and bonuses as agreed with each Contractor
* Second TS4 bonus from Diamond Dome is 2311 Crowns (193/Contractor)

## Objectives (6/16/736)
* Return to Happy Valley and re-establish friendly relations with its inhabitants
  * Another group of Contractors was sent to Pleasant Valley in May. While there one of those Contractors got drunk, increasingly aggressive and a fight ensued. There were fatalities, both halfling and Contractor, and the Contractors fled the valley. Only 3 of the 7 Contractors made it out of the Valley and only 2 made it back to Nexus. Maqamir questioned the survivors extensively and then they were charged with Breach of Contract. They've since been Expelled from Nexus.
  * Unbeknownst to most, Maqamir contracted with a wizard of [Magnus Arcana](../../markdown/wizards.md) to create a permanent __Teleportation Circle__ near Happy Valley in order to improve the efficiency of trade. This contract was a significant investment and was seriously jeopardized by the actions of the previous Contractor group. The process had been underway for 9 months and still had 3 more months until completion. TS4 was ordered to never divulge this information.
  * The __Teleportation Circle__ is being created in a cave approximately a mile from the Valley. In addition to the wizard (Slight) Maqamir has contracted with a group of dwarves from [Karrgerra](../../markdown/trade-partner-2.md) to inscribe the __Circle__ with silver and fortify the cave.
  * TS4 Contractors were instructed to travel to the Valley using the __Teleportation Circle__ during its daily casting and re-establish friendly relations with the Valley's inhabitants. TS4 was given 2 __+1 Shortswords__, 2 __+1 Shortbows__ and a __Ring of Protection__ to offer as gifts to the halflings to help engender good will.
* Contract began 7/18/736 8:30 PM at Tower Garden (the compound of Magnus Arcana)

## Contract Timeline
* 7/18/736 8:30 PM - A Novice of Magnus Arcana met the Contractors at the gates of Tower Garden and led them to an ellipsoid tower tiled with mirrors call The Eye which housed a permanent __Teleportation Circle__.
* 7/18/736 9:00 PM - The __Teleportation Circle__ was activated and a tattooed male half-elf (the wizard Slight) passed by the Contractors as they moved through. The Contractors slept in the cave while the dwarves (6) continued their work.
* 7/19/736 - Starting at sunrise
  * The Contractors left the cave and immediately spotted the halfling Jory Quicktoes who quickly disappeared into the brush.
  * As they continued towards the Valley they were attacked by an [Armanite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/266/330/1000/1000/636596677808633175.png) which they destroyed taking little damage.
  * Upon reaching the Valley entrance they found Sheriff Jasper Thornspeak, several halfling archers and 3 Guardians waiting. The Sheriff was prickly and clearly wanted the Contractors to leave but when they crossed the obsidian line and were not attacked by the Guardians he begrudgingly agreed to lead them to the Mayor.
  * As the Contractors traveled through the Valley they found that where previously the halflings acted with curiosity towards the new visitors they now presented suspicion, anger and fear.
  * Upon reaching the central plaza the Contractors found the Great Hall had been severely fire damaged through it was under repair.
  * Waiting at the plaza was Sas Buttercup and a group of halfling warriors. Mayor Big Bee had been killed in the conflict with the previous Contractor group and Sas was promoted to Mayor. She was openly hostile toward the Contractors.
  * On the verge of telling the Contractors to leave the Valley the wizard Old Bill made an appearance telling her he could use the Contractors help with an issue that was beyond him. She begrudgingly agreed that if the Contractors aided Old Bill as he instructed continued trade with Maqamir would be considered.
  * Old Bill lead the Contractors to the far eastern edge of the Valley where they discovered a group of [Manes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/30781/625/1000/1000/638061931777676406.png) at the far edge of the obsidian line furiously scraping away as a small crack in the obsidian. Old Bill said these demons has shown up a couple months ago and were very slowly damaging the barrier protecting the Valley. He initially destroyed them all but more returned. He traveled down the path on the far side of the obsidian line to investigate but encountered greater demons and was forced to turn back. He had told no one of this and was greatly concerned for the safety of the Valley. He was sure that if the Contractors helped him deal with this threat Sas could be persuaded to look favorably on them again.
  * Sylcros spent several minutes destroying the Manes with his Psychic Blades and then he, Tograin and Halflong moved stealthily down the trail scouting ahead and leaving the others with Old Bill on the Valley side of the barrier. A few hundred yards down the trail, around the side of a small hill, they spotted several [Vrock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/30781/648/1000/1000/638061932392542985.png) and decided to turn back to get the rest of the Contractors.
