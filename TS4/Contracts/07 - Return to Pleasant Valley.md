# Contract 7 - Return to Pleasant Valley (Success)

## Pre-contract (6/23/736 - 9/16/736)
* Contract 6 (Crypt Run) was completed 6/22/736
* [Maqamir](../../markdown/company.md) pays the Contractors 3 month's salary, benefits and bonuses as agreed with each Contractor
* Second TS4 bonus from Diamond Dome is 2311 Crowns (193/Contractor)

## Objectives (9/16/736)
* Return to Happy Valley and re-establish friendly relations with its inhabitants
  * Another group of Contractors was sent to Pleasant Valley in May. While there, one of the Contractors got drunk, increasingly aggressive and a fight ensued. There were fatalities, both halfling and Contractor, and the Contractors fled the valley. Only 3 of the 7 Contractors made it out of the Valley and only 2 made it back to Nexus. Maqamir questioned the survivors extensively and then they were charged with Breach of Contract. They've since been Expelled from Nexus.
  * Unbeknownst to most, Maqamir contracted with a wizard of [Magnus Arcana](../../markdown/wizards.md) to create a permanent __Teleportation Circle__ near Happy Valley in order to improve the efficiency of trade. This contract was a significant investment and was seriously jeopardized by the actions of the previous Contractor group. The process had been underway for 9 months and still had 3 more months until completion. TS4 was ordered to never divulge this information.
  * The __Teleportation Circle__ is being created in a cave approximately a mile from the Valley. In addition to the contracted Magnus Arcana wizard (Slight) Maqamir has contracted with a group of dwarves from [Karrgerra](../../markdown/trade-partner-2.md) to inscribe the __Circle__ in silver and fortify the cave.
  * TS4 Contractors were instructed to travel to the Valley using the __Teleportation Circle__ during its daily casting and re-establish friendly relations with the Valley's inhabitants. TS4 was given 2 __+1 Shortswords__, 2 __+1 Shortbows__ and a __Ring of Protection__ to offer as gifts to the halflings to help engender good will.
* Contract was set to begin 9/18/736 8:30 PM at Tower Garden (the compound of Magnus Arcana)

## Contract Timeline
* 9/18/736 - Tower Garden
  * 8:30 PM - A Novice of Magnus Arcana met the Contractors at the gates of Tower Garden and led them to an ellipsoid tower tiled with mirrors call The Eye which housed a permanent __Teleportation Circle__.
  * 9:00 PM - The __Teleportation Circle__ near the Valley was activated and a tattooed male half-elf (the wizard Slight) passed by the Contractors as they moved through. The Contractors slept in the cave for the rest of the night while the dwarves (6) continued their work.
* 9/19/736 - Starting at sunrise
  * The Contractors left the cave and immediately spotted the halfling Jory Quicktoes who quickly disappeared into the brush.
  * As they continued towards the Valley they were attacked by an [Armanite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/266/330/1000/1000/636596677808633175.png) which they destroyed taking little damage.
  * Upon reaching the Valley entrance they found Sheriff Jasper Thornspeak, several halfling archers and 3 Guardians waiting. The Sheriff was prickly and clearly wanted the Contractors to leave but when they crossed the obsidian line and were not attacked by the Guardians he begrudgingly agreed to lead them to the Mayor.
  * As the Contractors traveled through the Valley they found that where previously the halflings acted with curiosity towards the new visitors they now presented suspicion, anger and fear.
  * Upon reaching the central plaza the Contractors found the Great Hall had been severely fire damaged through it was well under repair.
  * Waiting at the plaza was Sas Buttercup and a group of halfling warriors. Mayor Big Bee had been killed in the conflict with the previous Contractor group and Sas was promoted to Mayor. She was openly hostile toward the Contractors.
  * On the verge of telling the Contractors to leave the Valley the halfling wizard Old Bill made an appearance telling her he could use the Contractors help with an issue that was beyond him. She begrudgingly agreed that if the Contractors aided Old Bill as he instructed, continued trade with Maqamir would be considered.
  * Old Bill lead the Contractors to the far eastern edge of the Valley where they discovered a group of [Manes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/30781/625/1000/1000/638061931777676406.png) at the far edge of the obsidian line furiously scraping away as a small crack in the obsidian. Old Bill said these demons has shown up a couple months ago and were very slowly damaging the barrier protecting the Valley. He initially took to destroying them but more always returned. He traveled down the path on the far side of the obsidian line to investigate but encountered greater demons and was forced to turn back. He had told no one of this and was greatly concerned for the safety of the Valley. He was sure that if the Contractors helped him deal with this threat Sas could be persuaded to look favorably on them again.
  * Sylcros spent several minutes destroying the Manes with his Psychic Blades and then he, Togrian and Halflong moved stealthily down the trail scouting ahead and leaving the others with Old Bill on the Valley side of the barrier. A few hundred yards down the trail, around the side of a small hill, they spotted several [Vrock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/30781/648/1000/1000/638061932392542985.png) and decided to retreat out of site so Sylcros could use his __Physic Wisper__ to call for the rest of the Contractors.
  * As Renard, Dr. Orwen and Drann moved towards the scouting group they were attacked by 3 [Babau](https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/25746/153/1000/1000/637880557159096680.jpeg) hiding along the trail. As the fight ensued one Babau used __Heat Metal__ on Renard's chain mail, another cast __Darkness__ and the final attacked with its Weakening Gaze. The scouting group, alerted to the ambush, move to aid their companions. The engaged Contractors suffered significant damage before the rest of the group arrived but then the Babau were quickly eliminated.
  * No sooner had the Babau been destroyed than the Vrock joined the fight flying in from the rear attacking with Poison Spores, Stunning Screeches and beaks and talons.
  * During the fight Halflong managed to defeat a Vrock on his own.
  * After the demons were all destroyed the Contractors stopped long enough to perform some healing before continuing down the trail.
  * Several hundred yards past where the Vrock were initially seen the Contractors found a tear or rift in space guarded by a [Hezrou](https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/30781/620/1000/1000/638061931586077246.png). The demon attacked with a Poisoning Stench, claws and a vicious bite but the Contractors dispatched it with little effort.
  * The rift was clearly a gateway to another plane and through it the Contractors could see a desolate land of darkness, fire and smoke.
  * Feeling emboldened by his recent success with a Vrock, Halflong decided to step through the rift. He immediately suffered grievous wounds from the hot, poisoned air, could not breath and was Poisoned. He quickly lept/fell backwards out of the rift to escape certain death.
  * Having no idea of the nature of the rift or how to close it the Contractors decided to travel back to the cave, wait for the wizard Slight to arrive for his nightly casting and ask for his assistance.
  * The Contractors moved back across the obsidian barrier where Dr. Orwen and Dran set out for the cave leaving the others behind with Old Bill
  * As expected Slight Teleported into the cave moments before 9:00 PM and then cast the daily __Teleportation Circle__. Afterwards, he listened to Dr. Orwen and Dran's description of the rift asking questions along the way. He agreed to help if he could on the condition that if he successfully closed the rift Maqamir would pay him 10k Crowns. Having no other options the Contractors agreed. Slight gave them a coin telling them to place it on a stone and speak his name when they reached the rift further warning them that he should NOT be summoned into a fight. Additionally, Dr. Orwen and Drann discussed the possibility of repairing the damage to the obsidian barrier with the dwarves who told them the magic was beyond them but that they could most likely patch over the damage with indigenous bedrock stone (for a fee to be arranged with Maqamir). Dr. Orwen and Drann then slept in the cave for the remainder of the night.
* 9/20/736 - Sunrise
  * Dr. Orwen and Drann traveled back to their companions and then the Contractors left the safety of the Valley and traveled towards the rift.
  * When they reached their destination they discovered 3 more Vrocks guarding the portal. Being at full strength the Contractors quickly destroyed the newly arrived demons taking little damage themselves.
  * Following Slight's instructions his coin was placed on a stone and his name spoken. Slight appeared and immediately began examining the rift. In short order he decided he could likely close it, cast a spell and the portal shrank into non-existence within seconds. Moments later Slight bid the Contractors well and vanished.
  * The Contractors and Old Bill returned to the Plaza to report the happenings to Mayor Sas. She seemed perturbed that Old Bill had never told her of the rift or the demons but was begrudgingly grateful to the Contractors for their help. She agreed to re-open trade with Maqamir provided that all future trade parties include one of of the Contractors that had now twice visited the Valley.
  * The Contractors took leave of the Valley heading back to the cave where they waited for the return of Slight and the daily 9:00 PM casting of the __Teleportation Circle__.
  * Upon their return the Contractors reported to Master Assessor and were debriefed. He gladly accepted the 10k Crown agreement made with Slight and further agreed that Maqamir would negotiate with the dwarves to patch the obsidian barrier.
