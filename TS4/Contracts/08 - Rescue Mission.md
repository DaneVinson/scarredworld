## Contract 8 - Rescue Mission
* 11/13/736 7:00 AM, Tuesday, Maqamir headquarters - Master Assessor Terramis Squeebus explained that Master Finnel (from Contract 5, Go Green), impressed by TS4's performance in Contract 5, requested TS4 specifically to secure and execute a new Contract.
  * Monday evening an aquantiance of Master Finnel, [Sir Marnus Amentus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10ArofA_QvjCBYqe2JiancTNj-xjI6t10/view?usp=drive_link), confessed to him that his son had been kidnapped sometime after 9:00 AM. There was a ransom note leaving no doubt.
  * TS4 was tasked with interviewing Sir Marnus and securing a Contract to rescue the boy
  * The Contractors decided to send Drann with Sylcros following discretely
* 8:00 AM, Amentus Manor, Silver Line district - Drann interviewed Sir Marnus
  * The boy (Barret) was last seen at 9:00 AM Monday when he left for his usual session with his tutor accompanied by his bodyguard Herman. Neither had been seen since.
  * A magical bracelet the boy wore was dropped outside Eastgate in an area called East Downs (Dr. Orwen comes from East Downs)
  * A ransom note was delivered by simple courier: _"We have your son. Thursday morning at exactly 9:00 AM you will leave a wagon at a location to be disclosed. That wagon will contain 1000 lbs of platinum. We will retrieve the wagon. If we do so and verify that it contains the expected platinum your son will be released by mid-day. Fail to do this and you will never see your son again."_
* 8:45 AM, Maqamir headquarters - Drann returned with a signed Contract for 100,000 Crowns (20% the cost of the ransom) to be paid on the return of the boy to his father
* 10:00 AM, Maqamir headquarters - TS4 sends Contractors to East Downs to investigate
  * Togrian (Mike)
  * Dr. Orwen (Drew)
  * Tycho (Drew)
  * Drann (Collin)
  * Grym (as NPC)
* 10:45 AM, East Downs - Contractors enter the pub The Roost owned by Blund Oresmith (male half-orc). Dr. Orwen is known and liked by Blund and informs the Contractors of several things he'd seen in the last few weeks that were out of the ordinary.
  * A respected good-woman, Dorma Slimm, reported watching her cat run across the yard, jump into the air and fly away to the east.
  * 3 goats went missing in a single week at the Hollard farm and the Justicars seem disinterested.
  * Two months ago the Stenn family sold their farm after losing their youngest to a Bugbear raid. The buyer seemed to have no interest in farming and the farm was going fallow.
  * After decades of running a market and selling their wares (meat) to all corners of Nexus the Rasshop family had recently closed their market/restaurant after making an exclusive agreement with a single vendor.
* 11:30 AM, East Downs - Contractors leave The Roost to investigate the rumors. They visited the Rasshop farm, interviewed good-woman Slimm, talked briefly with the new owner of the Stenn farm and inquired about the goats at the Holland farm.
* 3:30 PM, East Downs - With the evidence collected, including information from a remarkable urchin named Cinder, the Contractors decide that the Stenn farm's new owner merited a closer look. The Contractors decide to return to The Roost and wait until dark for further investigation.
* 5:30 PM, East Downs - The Contractors leave The Roost for the Stenn farm.
* 6:00 PM, East Downs, Stenn farm - Togrian investigates the barn under the cover of darkness why the remaining Contractors wait at the edge of the farm. As suspected from the intel provided by the urchin Cinder he locates a secret tunnel that leads towards the house. As he investigates the tunnel the remaining Contractors move to the barn drawing the attention of the new "owner". The owner attacks the Contractors and is a formidable warrior but no match for the combined efforts of the Contractors. He is slain.
* 6:15 PM, East Downs, Stenn farm - Togrian encounters a iron-bound locked door in the tunnel and turns back. The Contractors move into the farmhouse, locate a secret trap-door to the basement and move into it. They are immediately attacked by an invisible foe. Additionally __Fireballs__, __Ice Storm__ and crossbows are employed against them through a reinforced back wall as they battle the unseen assailant. Grym is dropped. In desperation Tycho uses __Dimension Door__ to move he and Dr. Orwen past the defensive wall to attack the foes behind it. There they encounter the wizard responsible for the spells used against them, two warriors and the Amentus boy in a cage surrounded by a magic circle inscribed on the floor. With judicious use of __Hold__ spells by Tycho and Dr. Orwen's stunning attacks they quickly incapacitate then kill the foes but not before one of them stabs the boy with a spear killing him. When the wizard is killed the invisible attacker becomes visible and, being heavily wounded, is dispatched quickly.
* 7:00 PM, East Downs, Stenn farm - The Contractors move the bodies to the barn, set fire to it and leave quickly for Maqamir headquarters with the boy's body.
* 8:00 PM, Maqamir headquarters - Upon return a priest is hired to cast __Raise Dead__ on the boy then he is magically healed.
* 9:00 PM, Silver Line district - Members of TS4 return the boy to his father.
* 10:00 PM, Maqamir headquarters - TS4 is debriefed by Master Assessor Terramis Squeebus.
