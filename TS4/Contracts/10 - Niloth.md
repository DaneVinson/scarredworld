## Contract 10 - Strike the Niloth
* 3/5/737 7:00 AM - Master Assessor Terramis Squeebus briefs TS4 on the Contract
  * Priests and Seers of Nexus identified the growing threat in the Southern Wastelands as a Niloth a powerful entity from the Negative Energy Plane. There's widespread agreement that its power grows rapidly and that it will bring about the destruction of Nexus within three years.
  * The Pentacouncil of Nexus voted 4 to 2 to post a 2 million Crown bounty on the verifiable destruction of the Niloth. The Contract is to collect that bounty. Maqamir feels highly confident the __Fallen Star__ is an Artifact uniquely suited for this threat.
  * TS4 is instructed to locate the Niloth's lair in the Southern Wasteland leaving the __Fallen Star__ in Nexus.  Once located a __Teleportation Circle__ would be used to deliver the __Fallen Star__ and bolster the group as needed. It was believed that the Niloth could be destroyed by contact with the __Fallen Star__.
