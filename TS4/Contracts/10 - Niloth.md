## Contract 10 - Strike the Niloth
* 3/5/737 7:00 AM - Master Assessor Terramis Squeebus briefs TS4 on the Contract
  * The Pentacouncil of Nexus voted 4 to 2 to post a 2 million Crown bounty on the verifiable destruction of the Niloth. The Contract is to collect that bounty. Maqamir feels highly confident the Fallen Star is an artifact uniquely suited for this threat.
  * TS4 is instructed to find the Niloth's lair in the Southern Wasteland (without the Fallen Star)
    * Use Teleportation Circle to deliver the Fallen Star and bolster the group as needed
    * Deliver the Fallen Star to the heart of the Niloth. Terramis Squeebus: "It's theorized that simple contact with the Fallen Star should destroy the Niloth." With an uncharacteristic casual shrug: "Throw it in and run I suppose."
